Right click on settings.cfg and open it in notepad
Every command is explained
Edit text or numbers between "", oposite of false is true, oposite of 1 is 0
When you will edit the file, save it, run Rust, open console (F1) and write: exec settings.cfg
If you dont like what you changed and you dont remember what you've changed, just open console (F1) and write: exec settings_default.cfg

It's also alright to use settings.cfg as it is, you don't need to edit it.
If you will need help add me on steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/stepanex/
