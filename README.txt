  copy everything into \Steam\steamapps\common\Rust\cfg (so you will have configs in cfg folder, not "Rust configs" folder under cfg)
  run Rust
  don't join to any server
  open console (F1) in menu and write:
  		  	For Default graphics: exec graphics_default.cfg
  		  	For Best graphics: exec graphics_best.cfg
  		  	For Medium graphics: exec graphics_medium.cfg
  		  	For Worst graphics: exec graphics_worst.cfg
  			
  After that, everything should be alright and working, now you can join server
  
  
  I also recommend reading, editing and then using settings.cfg, read settings_readme!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I'm taking none responsibility for damage done by this config, but I will of course try to help you
